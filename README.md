Hey,

This app was developed as part of a challenge from TRACTIAN, which you can view [here](https://github.com/tractian/challenges/tree/main/mobile).

The goal was to create a Tree View Application that displays company assets, organized by locations, assets, and their associated components.

To populate the tree structure with data, a fake API was used, available [here](https://fake-api.tractian.com). The app retrieves data using GET methods to access companies, their locations, and assets.

Additionally, the design of the app was based on the ([Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/IP50SSLkagXsUNWiZj0PjP/%5BCareers%5D-Flutter-Challenge-v2?node-id=0-1&t=ZxowLpXDFvQxdNks-0)) provided in the challenge's README.
